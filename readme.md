# Deep Learning Image Recognition with CIFAR-10

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image recognition using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is divided into training and test sets.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture used for image recognition includes convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. It is trained using the training set and evaluated on the test set.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (or Keras)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (`pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib`).
3. Run the `train_model.py` script to train the CNN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
4. Run the `test_model.py` script to evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

## Files Included
- `train_model.py`: Python script for training the CNN model.
- `test_model.py`: Python script for testing the trained model.
- `data/`: Directory containing the CIFAR-10 dataset files.
- `README.md`: This file providing information about the project.
